# Published & Verifiable Audit Deliverables

The Bellow audits  has  been  prepared  for  Our Clients  to  discover  and  analyze  the codebase  provided  by  the Relevant team  for  security  vulnerabilities,  code  correctness,  and  risk  of investment.  Each  codebase  has  been  comprehensively  examined  using  structural  analysis, behavioral analysis, and manual review techniques.

**Throughout the audit, caution was taken to ensure that the smart contract(s):**
- [x] Implements robust functions which are safe from well-known attack vectors.
- [x] The logic and behavior adheres to the associated documentation and code comments.
- [x] Transfer flows are designed in a sustainable way, safeguarded from i.e. infinite loops. 
- [x] Cross-comparison with similar smart contracts based on functionality. 
- [x] Does not hide potential back doors and implements sanity checks where suitable.
