# Chain Integrity: Integrating secure code with a safe experience. 
Work with a company that is committed to improve the security of decentralized finance for both inventors and investors by providing first-class security research. Our team consist of threat modelling specialists and smart contract auditors with in-depth proficiency in activities such as threat modelling, security auditing,  and risk analysis - enabling security coverage for the entire spectrum of actors including projects, communities, venture capitals, and HNWIs.

# Published & Verifiable Audits 

The audits below have been delivered to clients that reached out to us for performance optimization, code correctness, security assessment, and thorough risk analysis. Every codebase is comprehensively examined using structural analysis, behavioral analysis, manual review techniques, and threat modeling.

**Throughout an audit, caution is always taken to ensure that the codebase:**
- [x] Implements robust functions which are safe from well-known attack vectors.
- [x] The logic and behavior adheres to associated documentation and code comments.
- [x] Transfer flows are designed in a sustainable way, safeguarded from i.e. infinite loops. 
- [x] Cross-comparison with similar smart contracts based on functionality. 
- [x] Does not hide potential back doors and implements sanity checks where suitable.
